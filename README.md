# AML_transcriptome
Supporting repository for thesis of Long Noncoding Transcriptome in AML. This repository includes the supplementary tables for the chapter on transcribed super-enhancer in my PhD thesis.

- Table S2-3: SE loci annotated with their interacting protein-coding genes by pCHi-C data in CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells.
- Table S2-4: Comprehensive annotation of SE loci with their interacting genes in AML.
- Table S2-5: Putative novel interactions between SE loci and genes in AML.
